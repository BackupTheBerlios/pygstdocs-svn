  This tutorial is meant to be a quick way to get to know
  more about Gstreamer but it'll take some time to write it though because we don't know it ourselves ... yet. 
  We're usually using GTK in the examples but we try to keep the GUI code ta an absolute minimum so it
  should not get in the way. We take for granted that you are at least a fairly descent Python coder.
  For problems related to the Python language we redirect you over to 
  <ulink url="http://python.org">here</ulink>. :D

  As you may see this tutorial is far from done and we are always looking for new people to join this
  project. If you want to write a chapter just do it and submit it to some of the people having commiting 
  access to the  source. You find us
 <ulink url="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/pygstdocs/">here</ulink>. TIA
